A. following the example of OLS B hat is unbiased, we used matrix notation, where
E(Bhat|X) = B:
E(Bhat|X) = E((X'X)^-1 X'y|X) by def.
=(X'X)^-1 X'E(y|X), by cond. thm. 
= (X'X)^-1 X'XB+(X'X)^-1 X'E(u|X) BY LINEARUTY
= B by matrix prop and mean zero assumption

Now redo the proof, but assume E(u|X) = 0.65
What bias do you get?
Proof you answer by showing it in the proof. Due to the non-zero conditional mean, setting zero for a term containing an error term (X^T u) is invalid. 
This term introduces bias into the OLS estimate.

B: Write down all 4 sources of endogeneity
 1) Omitted Variable Bias; 2) Measurement errors in regressors; 3) simultaneous equations; 4) program or treatment evaluation with selection into treatment

C.) Below is a Haiku that describes a situation where endogeneity biased the estimation result. Which source of endogeneity does it refer to?
Haiku: Bias
Regressed hospital visits on mortality.
Found that hospitals kill people.
But Healthy donâ€™t go to hospital.
Answer: Omitted Variable bias, because it's likely that people are already sick and in critical condition, and they go to hospital. 

D.) Try to think of 2 (or up to 4 if you want to do one for each source) examples/regressions where an important source of endogeneity is likely to bias an OLS-estimation.
Answer: 
1. Omitted Variable Bias. Regressed size of the house on house price. Found that # of bedrooms raises the house's price, but they don't count area of the house. 
2. Measurement error in regressors,  BMI as obesity measurement; however it is a self-reported measurement and might mistakes occur. 
3. Simultaneous equations: have certain amount of row material, but need produce 2 products from it. 
4. Program or treatment evaluation with selection into treatment: work benefits, for example free gym membership to keep employees to stay within company, but this for every employer and not based on their perfomance.

Didn't do the coding part, since I have a problem with a laptop.
